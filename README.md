# blu - a simple JavaScript interpreter

blu - as the title suggests - is intended to eventually become a simple JavaScript interpreter.  
And with simple, i do mean _simple._  I dont target any specific version of ECMA/JavaScript, but just  
want to get a basic working bytecode interpreter that is easily embeddable in any C++ program.

Feature wishlist:
* Fully working bytecode interpreter
* Fully working compiler/parser for JavaScript
* Easily export C++ classes and functions to JavaScript
* Reasonable runtime performance
* Reasonable memory footprint
